We just published our local git repo
to remote GitHub.com repostory
Few things happened :
1. It automatically created new remote repo
     under your GitHub.com account
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo


Now our word will continue locally

1. add a new file called note.txt
2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in 
remote repostory so we PUSHED local commits to 
remote repostory using puch origin button
4. observe it has been added in your repostory under GITHUB.com
